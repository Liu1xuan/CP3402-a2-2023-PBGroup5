### a2.html
This file contains our team's, names, live site links, and project documentation; notably brief Local Environment and site goals.
* <a href="https://github.com/Huang-Yuanhang/Slack/blob/main/a2.html" target="_blank">a2.html</a>

### Local Development Environment
The website was developed using [XAMPP v3.3.0](https://www.apachefriends.org/) as the local server environment with [WordPress 6.4.2](https://wordpress.com/) installed on it.

Installation
---------------

### Prerequisites:

* XAMPP v3.3.0 or above
* WordPress 6.4.2
* Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE)

### Setup:

* Extract the WordPress 6.4.2.. ZIP archive to the htdocs directory in your XAMPP installation.
* Configure XAMPP to run the MySQL database and Apache server.
* Access the WordPress installation through https://localhost/wordpress-6.4.2/wordpress/ and complete the setup.
* Activate the custom theme from the WordPress admin dashboard under Appearance > Themes.

* For this project, access the staging/ live site through WP admin (login information in [a2.html](https://github.com/Huang-Yuanhang/Slack/blob/main/a2.html)) and export the backup through your choice of plug-in and import it to your WP environment.

### Theme Details

* Name: JCU Custom Theme
* Base: _s (Underscores)
* Main Technologies: PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, MySQL
* Custom Theme Files:
* style.css: The main stylesheet.
* functions.php: Theme functions and WordPress hooks.
* header.php: The header template.
* footer.php: The footer template.
* index.php: The main template file.
* page.php: Template for individual pages.
* single.php: Template for single posts.
* archive.php: Archive template.
* Additional custom templates and partials are included within the theme directory.

### Workflow for Development

1. Pull the Latest Code: If working in a team, ensure you have the latest version of the code from your version control system.
2. Develop Locally: Make changes locally within your XAMPP environment.
3. Test Changes: Thoroughly test your changes in the local environment.
4. Commit: Once tested, commit your changes with a clear commit message.
5. Push: Push your commits to the remote repository.

### Deployment

Deployment to the live server should be done in accordance with the established deployment procedures, which may involve:

* Manual file transfer via FTP/SFTP.
* Automated deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
* Direct commits to a production branch in version control, if configured to auto-deploy.
* Ensure that backups and a rollback plan are in place before deploying.

### Additional Notes

1. All changes to the theme and plugins should be tracked in version control.
2. Maintain coding standards and documentation for future developers.
3. Test on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
4. Due to being unable to configure the underscores theme name, '@package version2', as we didn't want to change and corrupt the whole file (this is untested), we decided to leave the name as that.
* this makes uploading the theme files to WordPress will leave the name of the theme as version2.
